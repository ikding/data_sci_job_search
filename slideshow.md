  * MOOCs (Coursera, Udacity, Fast.ai...)
  * Bootcamps (Metis, General Assembly...)
  * DS-focused undergraduate and master degrees
  * Advanced degree holders looking for career transitions

---
### Self reflection

* Don't apply to every type of data science job you find!
* Think about where you want to specialize

---
### Your first data science job may not be called data scientist

* Don't aim for perfection the first time! Get your feet in the door first
* It's normal to transition roles, projects, and companies throughout your career
* Optimize for learning and developing new skills in your first jobs

---
### Shotgun vs Sniper Job Search Approaches

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/86504444-65d5d000-bd86-11ea-83de-b5e559d5ea76.jpg"></img>

* Shotgun: scouring job boards for openings, applying for tens to hundreds of job postings online
* Sniper: more methodical and targeted job search
  * Identify sectors and/or companies that you're interested in
  * Conduct targeted information interviews

---
### Criteria on choosing a company

<p style="text-align:left;">Advice from [Stitch Fix Blog](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/advice-for-data-scientists/)</p>

1. Work for a company that leverages data science for its strategic differentiation: Company's core competency depends on its data and analytic capabilities; data science is more than a "supporting role".

2. Work for a company with great data: There is a difference between "data" and "aspirations of data". Ideally you'll find a company that already has enough data to do interesting things.

3. Work for a company with green field opportunities: Look for those companies that have a strong direction and strongly established data science teams, but have an array of problems they are solving for the first time.

### But how do you find out?

<p style="text-align:left;">Good recruiters and hiring managers have vested interest in presenting their best face forward.</p>

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104684570-2d586c80-56ae-11eb-9c42-1b47192c0f9b.jpg"></img>

---
### But how do you find out?

Ask people who may have more information. "Trust, but verify."

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104684582-35b0a780-56ae-11eb-9eda-c7dd2acd9d4d.jpg"></img>

---
### Importance of Network and Connections

<p style="text-align:left;">Connections in your professional network can help you by:</p>

* Heads-up on hiring situations (current or future)
* Insider-view on a company that may not be public info. For example:
  * "Company is expanding rapidly, lots of promotion opportunities"
  * "Eng team is under-staffed, so DS has to put on DE hats too"
  * "End of runway, funding in peril, layoff imminent"
* Suggestions on interview steps and prep
* Help with evaluation of job opportunities and offers

---
### LinkedIn (Professional Social Network)

* Immediate connections: your current and former colleagues / classmates, your friends...
* 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn
* Example use: (I found 3 of my 4 industry jobs this way!)
  * Look for 2nd degree connections in company of interest
  * Asking mutual connection for an introduction, then go for informational interviews and (perhaps) job referrals

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689872-33534b00-56b8-11eb-9cd6-b16425e6fff0.png" height="250px"></img>

---
### Indeed (Job Posting Aggregator)

* You can set up the job alerts so that it will be delivered daily to your email.
* Reginal search: "Data Scientist" jobs in San Francisco bay area
* Company specific search: "Company:(Capital One) (Data Scientist OR Data Engineer) jobs"

---
### Glassdoor (Employer Reviews)

* Glassdoor let employees and interviewees publish anonymous reviews or interview experiences of the employers.
* I use this website when I am doing research on the company that I am interested in, often before the informational and on-site interviews.
* More likely to have data for big employers

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689867-31898780-56b8-11eb-8bd8-0ac2792d974e.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Blind (Anonymous Professional Network)

* More likely to have data for big employers in tech, finance, etc
* Less curated, but more timely, information
* Anonymous reviews

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689874-33ebe180-56b8-11eb-8f2e-df898789f303.png" height="350px"></img>

---
### Crunchbase (Startup Funding DB)

* Fairly comprehensive list of start-ups fund-raising.
* Judging from last funding and number employees, you can gauge the length of runway
* Useful for start ups; not necessarily so for public companies (you can often find more publicly-available information)

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689863-2f272d80-56b8-11eb-94e3-dc30ff99138e.png" height="300px"></img>

<h2>Types of Interviews and Preparation</h2>
</section>

---
### A Data Scientist's Interview

"Data science interviews are the worst because data science is interdisciplinary: code for 'you have to know everything about all the disciplines.'  Depending on the company and the team, your interview might look like a software developer’s interview, or it might look a like a statistician's interview, and the bad news is that virtually none of the material overlaps." -- [Erin Shellman](http://www.erinshellman.com/crushed-it-landing-a-data-science-job/)

---
### Data Scientist - Skills Required

* Stats / Probability
* Modeling / Machine Learning
* Data Visualization / Web Dev
* Data Engineering / System Architecture
* Software Engineering
* Domain Knowledge (aka. Subject Matter Expertise)
* Business Acumen and Communication

<p style="text-align:left;">**Action:** Know your skill profile, your interest, and know what the company is looking for during earlier rounds of interviews. If you found yourself lacking on aspects that the company absolutely need, it's not a good fit.</p>

---
### Types of Interviews

* Coding Challenge
* Data Analysis Challenge
* Technical Interview (Phone or On-site)
* Business Interview
* Behavioral Interview

---
### Coding Challenge

<p style="text-align:left;">You are expected to solve some computation or data manipulation problem, using a language of your choice. Ideally, your solution not only have to be correct, but also have to scale well. If you can solve a problem in `O(n)` time, don't solve it in `O(n^2)`</p>

**Action:** play with [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) or [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com). But don't go overboard! Data Scientist's algorithm interview is often not as hard-core as that of a software engineer. (YMMV)

---
### Data Analysis Challenge

<p style="text-align:left;">Provide you a dataset and test your skills on data manipulation, cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The questions often contain both descriptive and predictive components.</p>

* Descriptive: What is the average amount of time a bike spends at a station?
* Predictive: predict # of bikes arriving at each station during a specific time span.

---
### Data Analysis Challenge - What I Look For

* Data wrangling: how well do you deal with messy data in the real world? Are you familiar with latest tools and best practices?
* ML: Do you _actually_ know how the model works (vs. just know how to call `scikit-learn` API)? Can you defend your choices in model selection and hyperparameter tuning? Do you choose the correct performance metrics?
* Code quality: do you write well structured and documented code? Following code quality best practices? Do you have unit tests?
* Communication: are you able to describe clearly and succinctly the results of your analysis?

---
### Technical Interview (Phone or On-site)

* The questions ranges widely depending on the interviewer, the company, and the position you are applying to
  * Data engineering
  * SQL queries & performance tuning
  * System and database / schema design
  * Algorithm questions
  * Code debugging, profiling, unit testing...
* Understand your audience and get an idea of what they are looking for

* Important to make the interview "interactive" by "thinking out loud!"

---
### Business Case Interviews

* Only minority of companies have this - don't spend time on this unless you're pretty sure it'll be on the agenda
* The questions ranges from linear-algebra-like (e.g. break-even analysis) to open-ended, data and business strategic questions
* Very company and job family specific

---
### Behavioral Interview:

* The behavioral questions are asked to figure out if you work will with others, how you handle conflicts, etc
* Employers wants to know you behaved in the past in order to predict your future with them
* Make sure to back up your answers with examples! (If you can tell a convincing story, even better)
* One popular approach to is to use the STAR (Situation / Task / Action / Result) format
  * Situation: context of your story
  * Task: what was required of you
  * Activity: what you actually did
  * Result: how well the situation played out

---
### Your question for them:

* A job interview is a two-way process in which two parties (you and your potential employer) decide if they want to "go steady".
* Make sure you have done some research on the company (and the interviewers) before your on-site interview, so that the Q&A time can be spent on things that aren't public knowledge.
* Well-thought and well-prepared questions for them will:
  * shows them that you are genuinely interested in the job and the company (and have done your homework before the interview)
  * provide you the best chance to collect information to make an informed decision.
* Having no questions at all does NOT show well - you will be passed as not-prepared, not-interested, or both.

---
### Your question for them:

Example questions:

1. What would be my main responsibility if I am hired? What are some of the example projects I may be working on?
2. What is your day to day like?
3. What are the personal attributes that set a successful employee apart from others?
4. What does a successful first‐year look like for new hire in this position?
5. How did you start in this company / why did you decide to work here?
6. Things that you like the most and the least about working at this company?
7. When can I expect to hear from you after this interview?

### Salary Negotiation

Highly recommended read, especially if you think there will be offers coming: ["Negotiating Your Salary: How To Make $1000 a Minute" (Chapman)](http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Your-Salary-Minute-Revised/dp/1580083102)

Older version in electronic format can be found online.

---
### Salary Negotiation

<p style="text-align:left;">Salary making rule</p>

1. Postpone salary talk until there's an offer
2. Don't do salary negotiation over the email - phone or in-person preferred
3. Know your market value, your own range, and your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement).
   * Ideal
   * Satisfactory
   * No-go

<p style="text-align:left;">Read the Chapman book for details!</p>

### Appendix

**Action**: join LinkedIn, build up your network, and establish a presence.
**Action**: set up job alerts for targeted geographies and/or companies
**Action:** conduct mock-up interviews with your friends and colleagues. Know your audience and understand what the company is looking for; but also accept the fact that you probably won't expect any of the questions.
Action: checkout [case interview tutorials](http://www.capitalone.com/careers/analyst/assessment/) available on line, which gives you a flavor of the questions that may be involved.
**Action:** google "behavioral interview" and understand the STAR format. Think about your past experiences and come up with answers for some popular questions (teamwork, conflict resolution, biggest strengths and weaknesses, etc.)
