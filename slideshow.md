### "Data Science" means different things to different companies!

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104556463-8237ac80-55f4-11eb-9abe-68ef4a2f7330.jpg" height="500px"></img>

Note: every company, depending on how the data science team is structured and its mode of interaction, has a particular definition of data science. So there's no one-size-fit-all.

### Venn Diagram of Data Science

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104556436-764bea80-55f4-11eb-9e49-100b61f4ed28.png"></img>

Note: This Venn diagram succinctly capture the three areas that a data scientist may be expected to be good at.

<h2>Type A vs Type B data scientist</h2>
</section>

---
### Type A (Analysis)

<style>
.container{
    display: flex;
}
.col{
    flex: 1;
}
</style>

<div class="container">

<div class="col">

* Concerned with making sense of data through rigorous analysis and statistics
* Deliverable: Business or product-level insights, conducting / tracking experiments, metrics monitoring, strategic product recommendations, etc
* Can code well enough to work with data but is not necessarily an expert in software engineering
* Tool box: Python / R, SQL, A/B testing, experimental design, data visualization, dashboards, Jupyter Notebook
* Names: DS, Decision Scientist, Statistician, Business analyst, Product analyst, Data analyst...

<!-- .element: style="width: 100%;" -->

</div>

<div class="col">

</div>

</div>

Note: Like C3PO in star wars, type A DS's outputs is geared towards other people.

---
### Type B (Build)

<style>
.container{
    display: flex;
}
.col{
    flex: 1;
}
</style>

<div class="container">

<div class="col">

* Concerned with building and delivering reusable data products in production, and support real-time business-impacting decisions
* Deliverable: Business-impacting models (recommendation engines, ads targeting, churn models, supply chain routing, fraud & anti-abuse models, etc)
* Very strong coders and may be trained software engineers
* Tool box: Python / Scala / Java, ML library (sklearn, xgboost, pytorch, tensorflow), Database, Cloud computing, Big data pipelines
* Names: DS, ML Engineer, ML Scientist, Applied (Research) Scientist...

<!-- .element: style="width: 100%;" -->

</div>

</div>

Note:

* Like R2D2 in star wars, type B DS's outputs is meant to be deployed to machines, or decision making systems.
* In reality it's never this "clean cut" - many DS roles contain a mixture of both.

}
</style>

<div class="container">

<div class="col">

<p style="text-align:left;">The media hype cycle around data science has enormously exploded the amount of junior talent available on the market over the past five years</p>

* MOOCs (Coursera, Udacity, Fast.ai...)
* Bootcamps (Metis, General Assembly...)
* DS-focused undergraduate and master degrees
* Advanced degree holders looking for career transitions

<!-- .element: style="width: 100%;" -->

### Your first DS job may not be called "data scientist"

<style>
.container{
    display: flex;

.col{
    flex: 1;
}
</style>

<div class="container">

<div class="col">

* Don't aim for perfection the first time! Get your feet in the door first
* It's normal to transition roles, projects, and companies throughout your career
* Optimize for learning and developing new skills in your first jobs

<!-- .element: style="width: 100%;" -->

</div>

</div>

Note:

* DS candidate pool has expanded drastically in the past 4-5 years, esp. among the junior end.
* International students sometime are at a disadvantage b/c of Trump admin's policy. It remains to be seen how it'll play out during Biden admin.
* My own career trajectory also started out with analysis and pivoted toward type B in recent years. (It's like gradient descent)

---
### Call to Action

* Reflect on your own strengths and career development goals
* Do more reading on the types of data science jobs out there

<p style="text-align:left;">References:</p>

* [Data science is different now](http://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/) - Vicki Boykis (2019)
* [Advice for Applying to Data Science Jobs](https://hookedondata.org/advice-for-applying-to-data-science-jobs/) - Emily Robinson (2018)
* [Quora: What is data science?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-data-science/answer/Michael-Hochster) - Michael Hochster, 2014
* [Data Science for Business](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-for/9781449374273/) (2013): A _very_ good reference for data science applications in business

Note: many dimensions to the career goal. Type A vs Type B, management track vs IC track, etc. Think critically about what you can convincingly sell to employers

### [Shotgun vs sniper rifle approaches in job search](https://ikding.github.io/shotgun-vs-sniper.html)

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/86504444-65d5d000-bd86-11ea-83de-b5e559d5ea76.jpg"></img>

* Shotgun: scouring job boards for openings, applying for tens to hundreds of job postings online
* Sniper: more methodical and targeted job search
  * Identify sectors and/or companies that you're interested in
  * Conduct targeted information interviews

Note: I started out with shotgun in grad school, it did not work out well. All my 4 industry jobs thus far are from sniper rifle approach.

### [Advice for Data Scientists on Where to Work](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/advice-for-data-scientists/)

1. Work for a company that leverages data science for its strategic differentiation: Company's core competency depends on its data and analytic capabilities; data science is more than a "supporting role".

2. Work for a company with great data: There is a difference between "data" and "aspirations of data". Ideally you'll find a company that already has enough data to do interesting things.

3. Work for a company with green field opportunities: Look for those companies that have a strong direction and strongly established data science teams, but have an array of problems they are solving for the first time.

Note: StitchFix's criteria is written in a way that sells their company well, but I think the criteria is extremely helpful as a framework.

1. LED vs credit cards
2. Data is an important competitive advantage and takes time to accumulate
3. Old technique, new domain can be pretty exciting

---
### But how do you find out?

* Good recruiters and hiring managers have vested interest in presenting their best face forward
* Ask people who may have more information

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104684570-2d586c80-56ae-11eb-9c42-1b47192c0f9b.jpg" height="250px"></img>
<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104684582-35b0a780-56ae-11eb-9eda-c7dd2acd9d4d.jpg" height="250px"></img>

---
### Importance of Network and Connections

<p style="text-align:left;">Connections in your professional network can help you by:</p>

* Heads-up on hiring situations (current or future)
* Insider-view on a company that may not be public info. For example:
  * "Company is expanding rapidly, lots of promotion opportunities"
  * "Eng team is under-staffed, so DS has to put on DE hats too"
  * "End of runway, funding in peril, layoff imminent"
* Suggestions on interview steps and prep
* Help with evaluation of job opportunities and offers

Note: in next slide, I'll take about some websites / resources. It can be split into divergent and convergent phases of the job search. In the divergent phase, you are keeping your radar open about interesting jobs that might exist out there. In the convergent phase, you might have already narrow down on certain companies and wanted to do research on them.

---
### LinkedIn (Professional Social Network)

* Immediate connections: your current and former colleagues / classmates, your friends...
* 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn
* Example use: (I found 3 of my 4 industry jobs this way!)
  * Look for 2nd degree connections in company of interest
  * Asking mutual connection for an introduction, then go for informational interviews and (perhaps) job referrals

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689872-33534b00-56b8-11eb-9cd6-b16425e6fff0.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Indeed (Job Posting Aggregator)

* You can set up the job alerts so that it will be delivered daily to your email.
* Reginal search: "Data Scientist" jobs in San Francisco bay area
* Company specific search: "Company:(Capital One) (Data Scientist OR Data Engineer) jobs"

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104797805-cd2cfd80-5775-11eb-942f-78b409d6dcba.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Glassdoor (Employer Reviews)

* Glassdoor let employees and interviewees publish anonymous reviews or interview experiences of the employers.
* Useful for doing research on specific companies, often before the informational or on-site interviews.
* More likely to have data for big employers
* Contains salary information too (but numbers may be out of date)

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689867-31898780-56b8-11eb-8bd8-0ac2792d974e.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Blind (Anonymous Professional Network)

* More likely to have data & community for big employers in tech, finance, etc
* Less curated, but more timely, information
* Anonymous reviews

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689874-33ebe180-56b8-11eb-8f2e-df898789f303.png" height="350px"></img>

---
### Levels.fyi

* Allows you to compare levels across companies
* Lots of salary and stock compensation data
* More likely to have data for SWE oriented jobs in tech

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://i.imgur.com/sCrMFRm.png" height="350px"></img>

---
### Crunchbase (Startup Funding DB)

* Fairly comprehensive list of start-ups fund-raising.
* Judging from last funding and number employees, you can gauge the length of runway
* Useful for start ups; not necessarily so for public companies (you can often find more publicly-available information)

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689863-2f272d80-56b8-11eb-94e3-dc30ff99138e.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Call to Action

* LinkedIn: sign up for an account, build up your network, and establish a presence
* Indeed: set up job alerts for targeted geographies and/or companies
* Play with other aforementioned websites to understand what information are available

### Stages of Interviews

* Algorithm Interview
* Data Modeling / Coding Interview
* Technical Interview (lots of flavors)
* Behavioral Interview
* Business Case Interview

Note: this is not an exhaustive list, just speaking from my own experience

---
### Algorithm Interview

<style>
.container{
    display: flex;
}
.col{
    flex: 1;
}
</style>

<div class="container">

<div class="col">

You are expected to solve some computation or data manipulation problem, using a language of your choice. Ideally, your solution not only have to be correct, but also have to scale well. If you can solve a problem in `O(n)` time, don't solve it in `O(n^2)`.

<p style="text-align:left;">Call to action:</p>

* Read up on [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)
* Play with [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) or [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com) for some example questions
* Don't go overboard! Data scientist's algorithm interview is often not as hard-core as that of a software engineer. (YMMV)

<!-- .element: style="width: 100%;" -->

</div>

<div class="col">

![ineffective-sorts](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ineffective_sorts.png)

</div>

</div>

---
### Data Modeling / Coding Interview

* Provide you a dataset and test your skills on data manipulation, cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The questions often contain both descriptive and predictive components. (Example data: bike-sharing dataset)
  * Descriptive: What is the average amount of time a bike spends at a station?
  * Predictive: predict # of bikes arriving at each station during a specific time span.
* Time duration: a few hours to over the weekend

<p style="text-align:left;">Call to action:</p>

* Read others' analyses of some data science datasets on kaggle, e.g. [New York Taxi ride](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration), [Crimes in Chicago](https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago), [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), etc
* If you don't have time: offer to submit project examples instead of company specific challenge

---
### Data Modeling / Coding Interview: What I Look For

* **Data wrangling**: How well do you deal with messy data in the real world? Are you familiar with latest tools and best practices?
* **ML**: Do you _actually_ know how the model works (vs. just know how to call `scikit-learn` API)? Can you defend your choices in model selection and hyperparameter tuning? Do you know the correct performance metrics?
* **Code quality**: Do you write well structured and documented code? Following [code quality](https://ikding.github.io/python_code_quality_for_ds/) best practices? Do you have unit tests?
* **Communication**: Are you able to describe clearly and succinctly the results of your analysis?

---
### Technical Interview (multiple flavors)

* The questions ranges widely depending on the interviewer, the company, and the position you are applying to
  * Data engineering (e.g. explain how map reduce work; tradeoffs on parallelization frameworks)
  * SQL queries & performance tuning (e.g. given these tables, write a query that gives you the data you want)
  * System and database / schema design (e.g. given the type of data and refresh frequency, and the analysis others want to do, design a set of table and schema that allow efficient read and/or write)
  * Algorithm & data structure
  * Code debugging, profiling, unit testing (e.g. This function is buggy and slow. Make it run faster, and write unit tests for it to make it less buggy)
* Understand your audience and get an idea of what they are looking for
* Important to make the interview interactive and collaborative by "thinking out loud!"

Note: There is a lot of things that a DS interview may ask. If you don't know what they might ask, it may drive you crazy. Do some homework...

---
### Behavioral Interview:

* The behavioral questions are asked to figure out if you work will with others, how you handle conflicts, etc
* Make sure to back up your answers with examples! (If you can tell a convincing story, even better)
* One popular approach to is to use the STAR (Situation / Task / Action / Result) format
  * Situation: context of your story
  * Task: what was required of you
  * Activity: what you actually did
  * Result: how well the situation played out

<p style="text-align:left;">Call to action:</p>

* Behavioral interview prep references: [1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-prepare-for-a-behavioral-interview), [2](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/guide/how-to-prepare-for-a-behavioral-interview/), [3](https://hr.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/behavioral-interview-tips-examples.pdf)
* Think about your past experiences and come up with answers for some popular questions (teamwork, conflict resolution, biggest strengths and weaknesses, etc.)

Note: Behavioral interview has lot of resources b/c it is used in a wide range of jobs. Company wants to understand your past experience to make prediction about the future behavior. You must give examples.

---
### Business Case Interviews

<style>
.container{
    display: flex;
}
.col{
    flex: 1;
}
</style>

<div class="container">

<div class="col">

* Only minority of companies have this - don't spend time on this unless you're pretty sure it'll be on the agenda
* The questions ranges from linear-algebra-like (e.g. break-even analysis) to open-ended, data and business strategic questions
* Very company and job family specific

</div>

<div class="col">

![business-cat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/105137411-1946ad80-5aa8-11eb-9bed-bcf370c33505.jpg)

</div>

</div>

---
### Your question for them:

* A job interview is a two-way process
* Make sure you have done some research on the company (and the interviewers) before your on-site interview
* Well-thought and well-prepared questions for them will:
  * shows them that you are genuinely interested in the job and the company
  * provide you the best chance to collect information to make an informed decision.
* Having no questions at all does NOT show well - you will be passed as not-prepared, not-interested, or both.

Note: analogy between dating -> long term relationships. You likely will stay at a job for 1 to many years, so it's not a decision to be taken lightly.

---
### Your question for them (examples)

1. What would be my main responsibility if I am hired? What are some of the example projects I may be working on?
2. What is your day to day like?
3. What are the personal attributes that set a successful employee apart from others?
4. What does a successful first‐year look like for new hire in this position?
5. How did you start in this company / why did you decide to work here?
6. Things that you like the most and the least about working at this company?
7. When can I expect to hear from you after this interview?

Note: these are just some example questions. You might also come up with a different set of questions toward your future peers or management.

### Offer Negotiations

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104799190-f18ed700-5781-11eb-8910-28c2d8e8d422.jpg" height="450px"></img>

---
### Offer Negotiations

Highly recommended read, especially if you think there will be offers coming: ["Negotiating Your Salary: How To Make $1000 a Minute"](http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Your-Salary-Minute-Revised/dp/1580083102)

Older version in electronic format can be found online.

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104799192-f3589a80-5781-11eb-916f-d962e6501ce8.jpg" height="350px"></img>

---
### Rule 1: Postpone salary talk until there's an offer

<style>
.container{
    display: flex;
}
.col{
    flex: 1;
}
</style>

<div class="container">

<div class="col">

<p style="text-align:left;">Avoid discussing and disclosing salary information until they are actually making you an offer</p>

* Otherwise you may be screed out of perfectly suitable interviews
* Otherwise the employer may use this information as a way to make a low-ball offer when the time comes
* As people's desire for something grows, so does their flexibility about how much they can afford

</div>

<div class="col">

![can-i-afford-you](https://media.giphy.com/media/XxQzg07Vn8wUpbojK2/giphy.gif)

</div>

</div>

---
### Rule 2: Know your market value

<p style="text-align:left;">Know your market value, your own range, and your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)</p>

* Ideal: biggest package you can imagine that still passes the "laugh test"
* Satisfactory: a salary that would have you feeling okay and satisfied about going to work
* No-go: the lowest acceptable number

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/105137805-c7525780-5aa8-11eb-925b-5edd418cf67f.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Rule 3: Don't negotiate by email

* Email is 100% verbal; communication has lots of non-verbal components (inflection, pauses, facial expressions)
* "Yeah, right" - is it "yes, indeed" or "are you serious?"
* Crippling the communication by subtracting all non-verbal signals cannot do any good
* Voice to voice will do; face to face is better

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eKDp7xvUdbCrC/giphy.gif" height="200px"></img>
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/jOpLbiGmHR9S0/giphy.gif" height="200px"></img>

---
### Many parts of the offer

* Tangibles
  * Base salary & bonus
  * Stock compensations (options or restricted stock units)
  * Responsibilities and job titles
  * Vacation / sick hours
* Intangibles
  * Company mission & growth trajectory
  * Team, managers
  * Personal growth & career development opportunities
* Companies may be more willing to negotiate on some aspects than others
