### [Shotgun vs sniper rifle approaches in job search](https://ikding.github.io/shotgun-vs-sniper.html)

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/86504444-65d5d000-bd86-11ea-83de-b5e559d5ea76.jpg"></img>

* Shotgun: scouring job boards for openings, applying for tens to hundreds of job postings online
* Sniper: more methodical and targeted job search
  * Identify sectors and/or companies that you're interested in
  * Conduct targeted information interviews

---
### [Advice for Data Scientists on Where to Work](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/advice-for-data-scientists/)

1. Work for a company that leverages data science for its strategic differentiation: Company's core competency depends on its data and analytic capabilities; data science is more than a "supporting role".

2. Work for a company with great data: There is a difference between "data" and "aspirations of data". Ideally you'll find a company that already has enough data to do interesting things.

3. Work for a company with green field opportunities: Look for those companies that have a strong direction and strongly established data science teams, but have an array of problems they are solving for the first time.

### But how do you find out?

<p style="text-align:left;">Good recruiters and hiring managers have vested interest in presenting their best face forward.</p>

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104684570-2d586c80-56ae-11eb-9c42-1b47192c0f9b.jpg"></img>

---
### But how do you find out?

Ask people who may have more information. "Trust, but verify."

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104684582-35b0a780-56ae-11eb-9eda-c7dd2acd9d4d.jpg"></img>

---
### Importance of Network and Connections

<p style="text-align:left;">Connections in your professional network can help you by:</p>

* Heads-up on hiring situations (current or future)
* Insider-view on a company that may not be public info. For example:
  * "Company is expanding rapidly, lots of promotion opportunities"
  * "Eng team is under-staffed, so DS has to put on DE hats too"
  * "End of runway, funding in peril, layoff imminent"
* Suggestions on interview steps and prep
* Help with evaluation of job opportunities and offers

---
### LinkedIn (Professional Social Network)

* Immediate connections: your current and former colleagues / classmates, your friends...
* 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn
* Example use: (I found 3 of my 4 industry jobs this way!)
  * Look for 2nd degree connections in company of interest
  * Asking mutual connection for an introduction, then go for informational interviews and (perhaps) job referrals

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689872-33534b00-56b8-11eb-9cd6-b16425e6fff0.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Indeed (Job Posting Aggregator)

* You can set up the job alerts so that it will be delivered daily to your email.
* Reginal search: "Data Scientist" jobs in San Francisco bay area
* Company specific search: "Company:(Capital One) (Data Scientist OR Data Engineer) jobs"

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104797805-cd2cfd80-5775-11eb-942f-78b409d6dcba.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Glassdoor (Employer Reviews)

* Glassdoor let employees and interviewees publish anonymous reviews or interview experiences of the employers.
* Useful for doing research on specific companies, often before the informational or on-site interviews.
* More likely to have data for big employers
* Contains salary information too (but numbers may be out of date)

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689867-31898780-56b8-11eb-8bd8-0ac2792d974e.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Blind (Anonymous Professional Network)

* More likely to have data & community for big employers in tech, finance, etc
* Less curated, but more timely, information
* Anonymous reviews

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689874-33ebe180-56b8-11eb-8f2e-df898789f303.png" height="350px"></img>

---
### Levels.fyi

* Allows you to compare levels across companies
* Lots of salary and stock compensation data
* More likely to have data for SWE oriented jobs in tech

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://i.imgur.com/sCrMFRm.png" height="350px"></img>

---
### Crunchbase (Startup Funding DB)

* Fairly comprehensive list of start-ups fund-raising.
* Judging from last funding and number employees, you can gauge the length of runway
* Useful for start ups; not necessarily so for public companies (you can often find more publicly-available information)

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104689863-2f272d80-56b8-11eb-94e3-dc30ff99138e.png" height="300px"></img>

---
### Call to Action

* LinkedIn: sign up for an account, build up your network, and establish a presence
* Indeed: set up job alerts for targeted geographies and/or companies
* Play other aforementioned website to understand what information are avaialble

### Coding Challenge

<style>
.container{
    display: flex;
}
.col{
    flex: 1;
}
</style>

<div class="container">

<div class="col">

You are expected to solve some computation or data manipulation problem, using a language of your choice. Ideally, your solution not only have to be correct, but also have to scale well. If you can solve a problem in `O(n)` time, don't solve it in `O(n^2)`.

Call to action: Play with [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) or [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com). But don't go overboard! Data scientist's algorithm interview is often not as hard-core as that of a software engineer. (YMMV)

---
### Data Analysis Challenge

<p style="text-align:left;">Provide you a dataset and test your skills on data manipulation, cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The questions often contain both descriptive and predictive components.</p>

* Descriptive: What is the average amount of time a bike spends at a station?
* Predictive: predict # of bikes arriving at each station during a specific time span.

<p style="text-align:left;">Call to action:</p>

* Read others' analyses of commonly used data science datasets, e.g. [New York Taxi ride](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration), [Crimes in Chicago](https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago), [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), etc

---
### Data Analysis Challenge - What I Look For

* **Data wrangling**: how well do you deal with messy data in the real world? Are you familiar with latest tools and best practices?
* **ML**: Do you _actually_ know how the model works (vs. just know how to call `scikit-learn` API)? Can you defend your choices in model selection and hyperparameter tuning? Do you know the correct performance metrics?
* **Code quality**: do you write well structured and documented code? Following [code quality](https://ikding.github.io/python_code_quality_for_ds/) best practices? Do you have unit tests?
* **Communication**: are you able to describe clearly and succinctly the results of your analysis?

---
### Technical Interview (multiple flavors)

* The questions ranges widely depending on the interviewer, the company, and the position you are applying to
  * Data engineering
  * SQL queries & performance tuning
  * System and database / schema design
  * Algorithm & data structure
  * Code debugging, profiling, unit testing
* Understand your audience and get an idea of what they are looking for
* Important to make the interview "interactive" by "thinking out loud!"

---
### Behavioral Interview:

* The behavioral questions are asked to figure out if you work will with others, how you handle conflicts, etc
* Make sure to back up your answers with examples! (If you can tell a convincing story, even better)
* One popular approach to is to use the STAR (Situation / Task / Action / Result) format
  * Situation: context of your story
  * Task: what was required of you
  * Activity: what you actually did
  * Result: how well the situation played out

<p style="text-align:left;">Call to action:</p>

* Behavioral interview prep references: [1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-prepare-for-a-behavioral-interview), [2](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/guide/how-to-prepare-for-a-behavioral-interview/), [3](https://hr.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/behavioral-interview-tips-examples.pdf)
* Think about your past experiences and come up with answers for some popular questions (teamwork, conflict resolution, biggest strengths and weaknesses, etc.)

---
### Business Case Interviews

* Only minority of companies have this - don't spend time on this unless you're pretty sure it'll be on the agenda
* The questions ranges from linear-algebra-like (e.g. break-even analysis) to open-ended, data and business strategic questions
* Very company and job family specific

---
### Your question for them:

* A job interview is a two-way process
* Make sure you have done some research on the company (and the interviewers) before your on-site interview
* Well-thought and well-prepared questions for them will:
  * shows them that you are genuinely interested in the job and the company
  * provide you the best chance to collect information to make an informed decision.
* Having no questions at all does NOT show well - you will be passed as not-prepared, not-interested, or both.

---
### Your question for them (examples)

1. What would be my main responsibility if I am hired? What are some of the example projects I may be working on?
2. What is your day to day like?
3. What are the personal attributes that set a successful employee apart from others?
4. What does a successful first‐year look like for new hire in this position?
5. How did you start in this company / why did you decide to work here?
6. Things that you like the most and the least about working at this company?
7. When can I expect to hear from you after this interview?

### Offer Negotiations

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104799190-f18ed700-5781-11eb-8910-28c2d8e8d422.jpg" height="450px"></img>

---
### Offer Negotiations

Highly recommended read, especially if you think there will be offers coming: ["Negotiating Your Salary: How To Make $1000 a Minute"](http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Your-Salary-Minute-Revised/dp/1580083102)

Older version in electronic format can be found online.

<img class="r-stretch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7269845/104799192-f3589a80-5781-11eb-916f-d962e6501ce8.jpg" height="350px"></img>

---
### Salary Negotiation

<p style="text-align:left;">Salary making rule</p>

1. Postpone salary talk until there's an offer
2. Don't do salary negotiation over the email - phone or in-person preferred
3. Know your market value, your own range, and your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement).
   * Ideal: highest number that can pass a "laughing test"
   * Satisfactory: a market-rate number that you think is fair
   * No-go: the lowest acceptable number

<p style="text-align:left;">Read the Chapman book for details!</p>

---
### Many parts of the offer

* Tangibles
  * Base salary & bonus
  * Stock compensations (options or restricted stock units)
  * Responsibilities and job titles
  * Vacation / sick hours
* Intangibles
  * Company mission & growth trajectory
  * Team, managers
  * Personal growth & career development opportunities
* Companies may be more willing to negotiate on some aspects than others
